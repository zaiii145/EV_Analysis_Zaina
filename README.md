Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
This project analyzes the dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

📊 Project Objectives
Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, invalid GPS coordinates, and duplicates.

Explore the dataset to extract insights about:

Most common EV makes and models.

EV distribution across counties and cities.

Trends in EV adoption by model year.

Electric range analysis and pricing trends.

Visualize key patterns using bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and interactive geospatial maps.

Build a Linear Regression model to predict the electric range of EVs based on features like model year, base MSRP, and make.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:

VIN (anonymized for privacy)

County and city of registration

Model year, make, and model

Electric vehicle type and eligibility for clean energy incentives

Electric range, MSRP, and vehicle location (GPS)

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning (linear regression)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis
